## Introduction
This is a simple inventory application where you can manage your categories and products. Its user interface has been developed responsively using the TailwindCSS framework. Also, vanilla Js is used to make the application dynamic and the object-oriented programming pattern is used in it so that each layer performs its task and everything is more organized.
